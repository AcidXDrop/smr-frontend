By\n    continuing to use the service, you automatically agree to any revisions of these terms.</p>\n  <p>ficsit.app reserves the right to reconfigure its offerings and organisation and may choose to do so\n    at any\n    time. This includes but is not limited to our services, website designs, membership pricing and\n    offerings,\n    advertising programs and partnerships, as well as staff related and/or administrative\n    restructuring.</p>\n\n  <h2>General Usage of Websites and Services</h2>\n  <p>By accessing ficsit.app services, you hereby represent that you are aged 18 or older, or that you are\n    aged 13\n    or older and do so with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>\n  <p>You will use ficsit.app services reasonably and as intended. You may not display, duplicate,\n    dismantle,\n    reverse engineer, circumvent, or repurpose any property or service owned or operated by ficsit.app\n    without\n    consent. You will not intentionally harm, disparage, or in any way disrupt the operation of\n    ficsit.app\n    websites, systems, property, or staff. You view and use all content at your own risk. We do not\n    warrant the\n    accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any content presented. User-submitted content expresses the\n    views of\n    the author, not necessarily the views of any staff at ficsit.app.</p>\n  <p>In the interest of upholding our community standards when it comes to etiquette, we ask you to\n    abstain from\n    interacting with user-submitted content that you do not find to your liking, rather than engaging in\n    active\n    disparagement of content you disapprove of.</p>\n  <p>The ficsit.app API may not be used in any application that is closed-source.</p>\n\n  <h2>Fair Use Policy</h2>\n  <p>Attempting to download files or otherwise record data offered through our services (including but not\n    limited\n    to the ficsit.app website and the ficsit.app API) in a fashion that drastically exceeds the expected\n    average,\n    through the use of software automation or otherwise, is prohibited without expressed permission.\n    Users found\n    in violation of this policy will have their account suspended.</p>\n\n  <h2>Anti-Piracy Policy</h2>\n  <p>We have a strict anti-piracy policy and will take proactive action against anyone whose on-site\n    activity\n    gives us reasonable grounds to believe they are using pirated content such as, but not limited to,\n    games and\n    software. Discussing, promoting or distributing such content on our sites will be met with\n    administrative\n    action.</p>\n\n  <h2>Accounts and User Identity</h2>\n  <p>In order to access certain ficsit.app services, you must create and utilise a singular account (i.e.\n    one\n    account per person) consisting of a username, email address, and password. Households or facilities\n    from which\n    multiple users (and therefore accounts) may access the sites and services are encouraged to inform\n    staff to\n    ensure that there are no potential misunderstandings in the case of moderation review. Users who\n    create\n    multiple accounts may have any or all of those accounts terminated with other measures being taken\n    to prevent\n    such abuse as appropriate.</p>\n  <p>It is your responsibility to ensure the email address attached to your account is up-to-date. In the\n    event of\n    you losing access to your account, your email address is the only method that can be used to reclaim\n    your\n    account.</p>\n  <p>When creating an account on our services, the username you choose must be appropriate for all\n    audiences (i.e.\n    be free of profanity). Accounts registered with inappropriate usernames will be subject to an\n    immediate ban.\n    It is important that you keep your account information secure. ficsit.app is not responsible for any\n    unauthorised use of your account. It is the sole responsibility of the user to keep these records up\n    to date\n    and your failure to do so may lead to you losing access to your account.</p>\n  <p>We encourage you not to disclose any personally identifying information on our services.</p>\n  <p>By creating an account, you understand and agree that access to these services may be restricted at\n    our\n    discretion.</p>\n  <p>Avatar and signature images shall comply with the site rules. If you are using links in your\n    signature or on\n    your profile page, please make sure that content featured on the linked website or webpage conforms\n    to our\n    requirements. Ensure that any animated images you would like to use as your avatar do not contain\n    excessively\n    involved animations that can be construed as overly distracting. We reserve the right to remove\n    animated\n    avatars at our sole discretion.</p>\n\n  <h2>User-submitted Content</h2>\n  <p>User-submitted content includes all data submitted to our services by a ficsit.app user. ficsit.app\n    does not\n    claim any ownership of your content.

You are not entitled to redistribute,\n    repackage,\n    sell, or otherwise distribute content without express permission from the associated content\n    owner(s), and/or\n    other invested parties, when applicable. For more information, refer to any applicable documentation\n    included\n    or associated with the file.</p>\n  <p>Additionally, you understand that we reserve the right to remove any content with or without reason\n    at our\n    discretion.</p>\n  <p>Given the volume of user-submitted content on our services, we rely on community reports and reactive\n    moderation when it comes to upholding our various rules and guidelines. The mere existence of a file\n    violating\n    our rules on our services does not imply our approval of, or indifference to said file. As such,\n    user-submitted content which is found to be in violation of our standards is not excusable based on\n    the\n    existence of other, similar submissions.</p>\n  <p>Any user-submitted content may not contain links to off-site mod binaries or archives.</p>\n\n  <h2>Prohibited and Illicit Content</h2>\n  <p>Content deemed illegal by US law, including but not limited to pornographic depictions of sexual\n    violence,\n    indecent depictions of minors, bestiality, necrophilia, etc., is strictly prohibited and will result\n    in\n    administrative action and when appropriate, notification to the proper authorities.</p>\n\n  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n  <p>ficsit.app is not liable for any damages incurred through the use of its services, including that\n    which may\n    be associated with the user-submitted content. You agree that any use of user-submitted content or\n    modifications made to your property is done at your own risk.</p>\n  <p>By submitting content to our services, you accept full responsibility for and absolve ficsit.app of\n    any\n    liabilities associated with your submitted content, including any potential damages it may incur to\n    anyone's\n    property or well-being, directly or indirectly.</p>\n  <p>ficsit.app is not responsible for any charges or fees incurred by any third-party service provider(s)\n    that\n    may result from the use of our services.</p>\n  <p>All ficsit.app services are provided as-is.
